## Docs Search

For the purpose of these simple and fast docs, we use a string match to search through the documentation. When a user types into the search bar and hits the "Enter" key or clicks the search icon, we iterate through the content in the `DocLink` classes as exported from the `docs/pages/docs/index.js` file.
